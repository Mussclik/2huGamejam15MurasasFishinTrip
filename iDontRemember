mussclik and kogasa janitor ai
	mussclik gets so lost and deppressed that eventually he loses himself into delusions. his corrupted magic flourishes and unleashes a large indomidable destructive bunny hoard ravages the city and destroys everything. its too powerful for even kogasa to easily dispell and the hero council having grown complacent, is unable to deal with the threat at all. meanwhile somewhere mussclik is having mad ramblings and going more into insanity and delusions and repeating his internal sentiments of being a worthless person who cant do anything by himself anymore and being forced to abide by the whims of kogasa and getting hurt emotionally and physically but unable to stop it. text about his experience flows in the magic around him.
