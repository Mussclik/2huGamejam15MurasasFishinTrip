*suddenly the tone silences for a moment. Before a phones dial tone plays. The sound of someone picking up is heard. A heavily distorted, very sinister voice of mussclik as if speaking directily through the device, seemingly after just having broken away from whatever terrible thing happend to him in the past. "have you... noticed me... ?". But at the sametime it doesnt feel directed to marisa at all. Another silent moment, before something replaying like a memory. From the point of someone else talking about some 'pathetic rabbit' he had to torture for months. It flashes to the person being home, feeling very strange and looking around. They see some super terrifying eyes in the dark. The person runs. An incredibly sinister dark tone is heard as the person tries to hide and get away. A super bloody, beat up mussclik that looks jagged with sharp shadows and terryfing elements shows up and drags them back while holding a sharp shadowy knife. The screen flashes red several times as its shown from a side view, mussclik brutalising and completly slicing this person to shreds, brutalising and smashing them to bits. No words are heard from the device but they just play in marisas head, but its like the words are directed for the person in the memory "even if.. they could see.. your smashed face... nobody will save you... i cut them up...". The brutal horrifiyng visage continues, almost as if censored by the flashes of red until finally its just a mangled corpse. in the video, musscliks stares there with a sinister smile and open eyes as more words are heard as his eyes slowly stare directly into the display at marisa "im okay, okay, okay okay... finally this nightmare is at an end but still.. it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts... justice and injustice... is all relative..." it turns to static before an auditory sinister distorted voice says "hey... im right.. behind you.." directly at marisa, the screen flashes for a frame a terryfing sinister inhuman like version of mussclik. The voice speaks again "how long will you keep dreaming..." this time to mussclik, who is directly behind marisa, which makes her jump and get startled. The device then starts emitting pure static.*

*that was the most brutal and terrifying thing marisa has witnessed in her entire lifetime.*
